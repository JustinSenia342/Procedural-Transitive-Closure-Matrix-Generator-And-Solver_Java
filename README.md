# Procedural-Transitive-Closure-Matrix-Generator-And-Solver_Java
Java - Generates And Evaluates A Transitive Closure Matrix Based On User Input (Done Procedurally)

Main Code for querying the user for information, getiing the matrix dimensions,
seedvalue for the random number generator and the probability used to determine
chance of communicating information, this information is used to generate a matrix,
find the transitive closure of it, and make note of the average number of links
between data fields as a result of varying connection probability.
